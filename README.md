# SimpleHQCreditCardChecker

Basically I have created a WinForms GUI and a Console application that validates the Credit card number as per three requirements specified i.e.:

1) Validate Length as per Card Type (AMEX etc.)
2) Validate BeginsWith as per Card Type (AMEX etc.)
3) Write the Luhn's algorithm to validate the series of numbers.

Concepts used: DataBinding, Linq, Interpolation, Service Oriented Programming, Interface based Programming, Error Provision

Improvement possibilities: Encryption, better error checking, Exception Handling, Dependency Injection, Extensibility, Parallel Tasks, UnitTesting (Extensive), Improvement in Type safety etc.
